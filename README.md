# What is trptools-bot?
trptools-bot is an unofficial open source discord bot which aims to provide easy to use shift hosting functionality to the [TrP community](https://www.roblox.com/groups/4572671/Trolleybuses-Fan-Group). <br>
<sub>This project is related to a web service by a similar name which you can view [here](https://github.com/Ticko-Grey/trptools)</sub>

### This bot provides the following features when configured properly:
- All-In-One Shift scheduler
- Beautiful formatted responses
- Persistent memory to store your group's state through a restart
- Easy-To-Use automatic and customizable staff signup sheets

### Furthermore, Many new features are planned to integrate this bot directly with trptools.com, including:
- Live vehicle embed in your server
- Shift scheduler integration with trptools.com groups

Finally, We are working on developing a not selfhosted bot for those who want us to manage the servers at the expense of customizability
